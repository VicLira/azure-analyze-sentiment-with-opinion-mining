The breakfast was good too with good options and good servicing times. The thing we didn't like was that the toilet in our bathroom was smelly. It could have been that the toilet was broken before we arrived. Either way, it was very uncomfortable. Once we notified the staff, they came and cleaned it and left candles."

It was close to bus stops and grocery stores. If you want to be close to campus I will recommend it, otherwise, might be better to stay in a cleaner one."
